# Discord Notifier

This RuneLite plugin enhances your daily grinds by sending real-time updates to your Discord channel. You can get notified
instantly when you:
- Level up a skill
- Complete a quest or clue
- Receive a pet or a valuable drop
- Complete a collection log or combat achievement
- Or unfortunately meet your character's demise. 
For added proof and bragging rights, the plugin can optionally include a screenshot with each notification.
