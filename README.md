# Discord Notifier

This is a plugin for RuneLite which sends a message to your discord channel when you level up, complete a quest or when
you die. The message includes what skill you levelled or quest you completed and optionally a screenshot as proof.

In order to use this plugin you will need to create a webhook on your discord server. Below are instructions for how to
do so:

1. Open your Server Settings and head into the Integrations tab
2. Click the "Create Webhook" button to create a new webhook
3. Once created, copy the webhook URL and insert into the "Webhook URL" box in the plugin's configuration in RuneLite.
